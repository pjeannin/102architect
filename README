102architect is the second project in the first Epitech year

The goal is to compute coordinates of a point after servral transformations (scaling,
rotating ...)

How to use 102architect :

USAGE
    ./102architect x y transfo1 arg11 [arg12] [transfo2 arg12 [arg22]] ...
DESCRIPTION
    x   abscissa of the original point
    y   ordinate of the original point
    transfo arg1 [arg2]

    -t i j  translation along vector (i, j)
    -z m n  scaling by factors m (x-axis) and n (y-axis)
    -r d    rotation centered in O by a d degree angle
    -s d    reflection over the axis passing through O with an inclination angle of d degrees
